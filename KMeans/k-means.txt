k=2
divide the dataset by k clusters
//iterative
choose from the data set randomly k points

compute distances of all points with respect to the chosen points
	C1	C2
	1,1 2,1
1,1
2,1
4,4
5,4
compare distances and classify to which set point the point is closer

next iteration
get average of all points from each classification
and they will be the set point
compute distances again
then approximate again from the distance

if all has the same classification from previous. terminate
